        <p class="pa">One day I and my fellow partner were drinking some coffee and we then decided because we both knew how to cook to make a cafe. So we started by making money and building to make our beloved cafe. This cafe is food and coffee is so delicious that when I started to eat my doughnut and drink my coffee I couldn't stop. This is how are cafe started and I think you should come and try it.</p>
